#NLP Editor

##What is it

NLP Editor aims to be a free and easy-to-use dependency editor using
the Stanford Parser. It is currently in a very early stage of development.

##How to build or run

We now use Apache Ant as building tool. `ant compile` compiles the code.
`ant jar` makes the jar archive, while `ant run` run the program. When you
first use the code, please copy the class files in Stanford Parser to
`build/classes` directory, and also the englishPCFG.ser.gz.
